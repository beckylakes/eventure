# Eventure: Your Music Adventure Starts Here üé∂
Welcome to Eventure, an event platform targeted at helping to connect you with all the latest events across the globe and locally.

## Project Summary üìö
Built using Next.js 15, Eventure is a comprehensive, full-stack events platform created to allow music lovers to discover global or local events, and also provides a platform for event organisers to share their events with the community.

## To do list üìù
* More social features: see who is attending an event, becoming friends with people attending the same event, sharing events via socials (I realised early on in the project that these particularly pose security risks to users that, given the timeframe, I felt I could not effectively address so these have been left for now!)
* RBAC for protected routes (I am very actively working on this!)
* Confirmation emails upon signing up, and also upon attending an event
